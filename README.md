# Python Calculator Project

Welcome to the **Python Calculator Project**! This is a straightforward yet fun calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## üéâ Overview

This calculator allows you to:
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers with ease.
- Continue calculations using the result of previous operations.
- Have a good laugh with a silly easter egg!

## üìÑ Code Structure

Here's how the project is structured:

```python
def add(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2

def subtract(n1, n2):
    return n1 - n2

def multiply(n1, n2):
    return n1 * n2

def divide(n1, n2):
    return n1 / n2

2. **Run the Calculator**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## ü§™ Easter Egg Alert!

Feeling a bit adventurous? If at any point you want to escape the seemingly endless calculations, simply enter the mystical number **`8008569420`**! Voil√†! You will be freed from the clutches of the while loop. üéâ 

It's like a secret code to unlock the exit door of this mathematical maze! Who knew calculators could be this fun?

## üîç Sample Output

Here's a sneak peek at what the calculator looks like in action:

What's the first number? 5
Pick an operation: +
What's the next number? 3
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 8.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n

(And then it clears the screen)
```
